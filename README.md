@HACK CAMBRIDGE ATLAS 2022

## Inspiration
On the 17th of December 2021, one months worth of rain fell in a single day, flooding Malaysia and displacing tens of thousands of people. Despite our best efforts in slowing down the rate of climate change, we cannot deny that our planet is currently experiencing its effects.

Our aim was to create an automated flood helpline to aid the rescue efforts of Government organisations. During a flash flood, victims won't have time or bandwidth to download dedicated apps or navigate social media sites to seek help. We wanted a system which wouldn't gatekeep rescue to the technologically able.

## What it does

Victims are able to call in or text to report their situation, which is then relayed to a rescue coordinator. Our system visualises the locations of victims and clusters them into groups which rescue boats can be dispatched to.

## How we built it

We used the Twilio API to receive calls and text messages and Deepgram to convert the phone recordings into text. Our backend was built on Python.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Imagine using the Twilio API and being greeted with a message inviting us to press any key to run our code... Then telling us there was an error. This was highly disappointing at first as we had made the mistake of celebrating too early, but in the marginally longer run, it just made our "Hello World" more rewarding.

## What we learned

For most of our team, our understanding of distributed systems was limited to the Further Java tick. During the 24 hours, we learned a lot about connecting APIs, hosting and producing a pipeline.
